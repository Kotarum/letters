Hi everyone!

I am currently a student at Ironhack, trying to learn some data analytics.
I had an idea for a project outside the learning schedule, and here I am showing it to the world with my recently learned tools.

- Objective: analyze the distribution of letters in the Spanish language, compare it between different contexts, and see if there are statistical differences.
